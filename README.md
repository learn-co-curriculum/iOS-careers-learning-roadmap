## Technologies To Try Out
- [ ] [AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation/) 
	-  AVFoundation is the full featured framework for working with time-based audiovisual media on iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. Using AV Foundation, you can easily play, create, and edit QuickTime movies and MPEG-4 files, play HLS streams, and build powerful media functionality into your apps. [Docs]()
	
- [ ] [Core Location](https://developer.apple.com/reference/corelocation)
	-  The Core Location framework provides services for determining a device’s geographic location, altitude, orientation, or position relative to a nearby iBeacon. The framework uses all available onboard hardware, including Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, magnetometer, barometer, and cellular hardware to gather data.

- [ ] [Core Motion](https://developer.apple.com/reference/coremotion)
	- The Core Motion  framework lets your application receive motion data from device hardware and process that data. The framework supports accessing both raw and processed accelerometer data using Block object interfaces. For devices with a built-in gyroscope, you can retrieve the raw gyro data as well as processed data reflecting the attitude and rotation rates of the device. You can use both the accelerometer and gyro-based data for games or other apps that use motion as input or as a way to enhance the overall user experience.
	
- [ ] [Healthkit](https://developer.apple.com/healthkit/)
 -  Healthkit can be used to develop health and fitness apps that work together. Adding HealthKit into your iOS and watchOS apps creates a more integrated user experience. When a customer provides permission for your app to read and write health and activity data to their Health app, your app can become a valuable health data source and it can use the shared data to bring more powerful health and fitness solutions.
 
- [ ] [Core Image](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/CoreImaging/ci_intro/ci_intro.html)
	- Core Image is an image processing and analysis technology designed to provide near real-time processing for still and video images. It operates on image data types from the Core Graphics, Core Video, and Image I/O frameworks, using either a GPU or CPU rendering path. Core Image hides the details of low-level graphics processing by providing an easy-to-use application programming interface (API)

- [ ] [CoreGraphics](https://developer.apple.com/reference/coregraphics)
	- The Core Graphics framework is based on the Quartz advanced drawing engine. It provides low-level, lightweight 2D rendering with unmatched output fidelity. You use this framework to handle path-based drawing, transformations, color management, offscreen rendering, patterns, gradients and shadings, image data management, image creation, and image masking, as well as PDF document creation, display, and parsing.
	
- [ ] [CoreAnimation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreAnimation_guide/Introduction/Introduction.html)
	- Core Animation is a graphics rendering and animation infrastructure available on both iOS and OS X that you use to animate the views and other visual elements of your app. With Core Animation, most of the work required to draw each frame of an animation is done for you. All you have to do is configure a few animation parameters (such as the start and end points) and tell Core Animation to start. 
- [ ] [Haptic Feedback](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uifeedbackgenerator)
	- Haptic feedback provides a tactile response, such as a tap, that draws attention and reinforces both actions and events. While many system-provided interface elements (for example, pickers, switches, and sliders) automatically provide haptic feedback, you can use feedback generators to add your own feedback to custom views and controls.
- [ ] [MapKit](https://developer.apple.com/reference/mapkit)
	- The MapKit framework provides an interface for embedding maps directly into your own windows and views. This framework also provides support for annotating the map, adding overlays, and performing reverse-geocoding lookups to determine placemark information for a given map coordinate
- [ ] [3D Touch](https://developer.apple.com/ios/3d-touch/)
	- 3D Touch allows apps to sense how deeply users press the display, letting them do more than ever with your apps and games.

- [ ] [CoreBluetooth](https://developer.apple.com/reference/corebluetooth)
	- The Core Bluetooth framework provides the classes needed for your apps to communicate with devices that are equipped with Bluetooth low energy wireless technology
- [ ] [AudioKit](http://audiokit.io/)
	- AudioKit provides powerful audio synthesis, processing, and analysis, without the steep learning curve
- [ ] [MultipeerConnectivity](https://developer.apple.com/reference/multipeerconnectivity)
	- The Multipeer Connectivity framework supports the discovery of services provided by nearby devices and supports communicating with those services through message-based data, streaming data, and resources (such as files).
- [ ] [CloudKit](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/)
	- CloudKit provides authentication, a private and a public database, and structured asset storage services—so you can focus on client-side development.
